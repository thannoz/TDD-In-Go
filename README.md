## Introduction

This project aims to deepen your understanding of the Go programming language by systematically covering its key concepts and features. By employing TDD, you will not only learn Go but also practice writing clean, reliable, and maintainable code.

## Goals

- Master the core concepts of Go.
- Develop a solid understanding of Go's concurrency model.
- Build robust applications using Go.
- Practice writing tests first and implementing features second (TDD approach).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages, each focusing on a specific topic in Go. Each package contains:

- **Source Code**: Implementations of concepts and features.
- **Tests**: Unit tests written using the TDD approach.
- **Documentation**: Explanations and examples of the concepts covered.
